\begin{abstract}
 Electromagnetic wave excitation by sources with nonsymmetric electric-current distribution in the presence of a semi-infinite gyrotropic cylinder is considered.
 It is assumed that the sources are specified on the surface of the cylinder located in free space.
 The total source-excited field and the fields scattered by the end-face of the cylinder are expanded in terms of eigenwaves of an infinite open waveguide and free space.
 The powers radiated from the source in both the directions of the cylinder are numerically calculated and the radiation pattern for the far-zone field is determined.
 Conditions are found..

\section{Introduction}

In the past decades, an enhanced attention has been paid to the problem of electromagnetic wave excitation in systems including open gyrotropic guiding structures and given electric currents.
In the case of employing a magnetized plasma as a gyrotropic medium, such a model can be used for describing antennas operated in laboratory devices -- helicon plasma sources, which are used in numerous experimental researches \cite{Chen_review_2015}.
In that type of radiating systems, it is important to take into account the finite size of a plasma column  when diffraction effects on its end-face take place.
However, most theoretical studies devoted to such sources deal with the case where antenna is placed far from the ends of a plasma column so that it can be represented as an infinite cylinder [].
Moreover, in most works consideration is limited to the excitation of only the discrete-spectrum waves (eigenmodes), which play a major role in forming the plasma discharge.
%The analysis of radiation characteristics of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of an open plasma-filled cylindrical waveguide of infinite length was performed in [] by taking into account the full spectrum of excited waves.
In the case of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of an infinite plasma-filled cylindrical waveguide surrounded by free space, the full spectrum of excited waves was taken into account for determining the energy characteristics \cite{OstafEskin_APRASC2019} and radiation patterns \cite{OstafEskin_ICEAA2019} of such a source.
%Для правильного описания излучения необходимо учитывать конечность плазменного столба.

In this work the energy and radiation characteristics of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of a semi-infinite gyrotropic cylinder is considered.
The investigation of the excited field and fields of waves scattered by the end-face of the cylinder is performed using an expansion of these fields over the set of eigenwaves of an infinite open gyrotropic waveguide \cite{EskinPIERS2017_meth} and free space.

%\section{Layout}


%The URSI Summary Paper should be single spaced, two column and
%\textbf{sized for A4 paper} according to this template. The paper should be
%\textbf{at least 2 pages long} and no longer than \textbf{4 pages}. Note
%that this template does \emph{not} meet the minimum length requirements: it
%does not completely fill at least two pages

%The body text should be Times New Roman 10~pt. Sections should be titled
%and numbered in bold, with Times New Roman 12~pt. The top and bottom
%margins should be 2.5~cm (1~inch), and the left- and right-hand margins
%should be 1.6~cm (0.63~inch). Paragraphs should be separated with one blank
%line. Do not indent paragraphs.

%The title should be centered according to this template. The author's (or
%authors') name and complete organizational affiliation should be two lines
%below the title. If there are multiple authors, the presenter is to be
%identified with an asterisk. The text should start three lines below the
%last name.


\section{Formulation of the Problem}

%The paper should include an abstract and the usual subsections and should
%be in English.

%Citations and references should follow IEEE format (as used by the
%\emph{Radio Science Bulletin}).  Citations can be of the
%form~\cite{cannon,mannix} as is appropriate to the sentence, with the
%reference format illustrated at the end of this template.

\section{The Source-Excited and Diffracted Fields}

%Equations should be centered with the equation numbers right justified in
%the following format:
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:T}
%  T' = \frac{r_\text{e}^2\lambda^2GC_\text{s}L
%    \sec\theta\sqrt{\pi}\ \Gamma\!\left(\frac\rho2\right)}
%  {4\pi^2\,\Gamma\!\left(\frac{\rho+1}{2}\right)}.
%\end{equation}

\section{Numerical results}
%\subsection{Figures}

%Figures should include a caption beneath the figure (in Times Roman 10 pt.)
%and the caption should include the Figure number in
%bold. Figure~\ref{fig:asc} provides an example.

%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics[width=70mm]{ascension_island}
%  \caption{Ascension Island (7.9\textdegree S, 14.8\textdegree W showing
%    the ESA Tracking Station which was the location of the fixed receiver
%    and the road (shown in black) along which the mobile measurements were
%    made).}
%  \label{fig:asc}
%\end{figure}

%\subsection{Tables}

%Likewise, tables should include a caption (in Times Roman 10 pt.) but this
%time above the table. The caption should include the table number in bold.
