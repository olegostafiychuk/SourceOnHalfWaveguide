\begin{abstract}
 Electromagnetic wave excitation by sources with nonsymmetric electric-current distribution in the presence of a semi-infinite gyrotropic cylinder is considered.
 It is assumed that the sources are specified on the surface of the cylinder located in free space.
 The total source-excited field and the fields scattered by the end-face of the cylinder are expanded in terms of eigenwaves of an infinite open waveguide and free space.
 The powers radiated from the source in both the directions of the cylinder are numerically calculated and the radiation pattern for the far-zone field is determined.
 Conditions are found..

\section{Introduction}

In the past decades, an enhanced attention has been paid to the problem of electromagnetic wave excitation in systems including open gyrotropic guiding structures and given electric currents.
In the case of employing a magnetized plasma as a gyrotropic medium, such a model can be used for describing antennas operated in laboratory devices -- helicon plasma sources, which are used in numerous experimental researches \cite{Chen_review_2015}.
In that type of radiating systems, it is important to take into account the finite size of a plasma column  when diffraction effects on its end-face take place.
However, most theoretical studies devoted to such sources deal with the case where antenna is placed far from the ends of a plasma column so that it can be represented as an infinite cylinder [].
Moreover, in most works consideration is limited to the excitation of only the discrete-spectrum waves (eigenmodes), which play a major role in forming the plasma discharge.
%The analysis of radiation characteristics of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of an open plasma-filled cylindrical waveguide of infinite length was performed in [] by taking into account the full spectrum of excited waves.
In the case of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of an infinite plasma-filled cylindrical waveguide surrounded by free space, the full spectrum of excited waves was taken into account for determining the energy characteristics \cite{OstafEskin_APRASC2019} and radiation patterns \cite{OstafEskin_ICEAA2019} of such a source.

In this work the energy and radiation characteristics of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of a semi-infinite gyrotropic cylinder is considered.
The investigation of the excited field and fields of waves scattered by the end-face of the cylinder is performed using an expansion of these fields over the set of eigenwaves of an infinite open gyrotropic waveguide \cite{EskinPIERS2017_meth} and free space.

\section{Formulation of the Problem}
Let us consider a semi-infinite cylinder of radius $ a $ located in free space and filled with a cold collisionless magnetoplasma.
The cylinder axis is parallel to an external static magnetic field $ \textbf{B}_{0} $ and coincides with the $ z $ axis of the cylindrical coordinate system ($ \rho, \phi, z $).
The endface of the cylinder lies in the plane $ z=0 $.
The plasma inside the cylinder is described by dielectric permittivity tensor which has the following form for a monochromatic signal:
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\hat{\varepsilon}=\epsilon_{0}\!\!
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\varepsilon & -ig & 0 \\
ig & \varepsilon & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \eta
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}
Here, $ \epsilon_{0} $ is the permittivity of free space, and the quantities $\varepsilon$, $g$, and $\eta$ for a cold collisionless magnetoplasma can be written as
\begin{align} \label{eq2}
\varepsilon &=\!1+\frac{\op^2}{\oH^2-\omega^2}+\frac{\Op^2}{\OH^2-\omega^2}, \nonumber \\
g&=-\frac{\op^2\oH}{(\oH^2-\omega^2)\omega}+\frac{\Op^2\OH}{(\OH^2-\omega^2)\omega}, \\
\eta&=1-\frac{\op^2}{\omega^2}-\frac{\Op^2}{\omega^2}. \nonumber
\end{align}
In (\ref{eq2}) we used standard notations  $ \op $ and $ \Op $ for the electron and ion plasma frequencies, and $ \oH $ and $ \OH $ for the gyrofrequencies of the corresponding particles, respectively.
The source is represented as an electric current specified on the side surface of the cylinder with density written, with the $ \exp(i\omega t) $ time dependence dropped, as
\begin{align} \label{eq3}
{\bf J}({\bf r})=&\,({\pmb\phi}_{0}j_{\phi}+{\bf z}_0j_z)\delta(\rho-a) \nonumber \\
&\times\exp\left(-im\phi-ik_0{\tilde p}z\right),\\
&-L-d<z<-L+d. \nonumber
\end{align} 
Here, $ d $ is the half-length of the antenna, $ L $ characterizes the distance between the antenna and the endface of the cylinder, integer $ m $ and the constant $ \tilde p $ determine the dependence of the current on the azimuthal and longitudinal coordinates, respectively, and $ k_0=\omega/c $ is the wave number in free space ($ c $  is the speed of light in free space).
The total amplitude of the current can be found as  $ |I_0|^2=|I_\phi|^2+|I_z|^2 $, where $ I_\phi=2dj_{\phi} $ and $ I_z=2\pi aj_z $.
