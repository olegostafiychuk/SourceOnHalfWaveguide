\section{Introduction}

In the past decades, an enhanced attention has been paid to the theoretical study of the problem of the electromagnetic wave excitation in systems including open gyrotropic guiding structures and given electric currents.
In the case of employing a magnetized plasma as a gyrotropic medium, such a model can be used for describing antennas operated in laboratory devices -- helicon plasma sources, which are of importance for numerous experimental researches [1--3]. %\cite{Chen_review_2015, Caneses_Blackwell, Amatucci2011}.
%which are of big interest for laboratory studies
In most studies devoted to such sources, consideration is limited to the excitation of only the discrete-spectrum waves (eigenmodes),
which play a major role in forming the plasma discharge.
Many works considering the complete spectrum of the excited waves deal with the case where an antenna is placed far from the ends of a plasma column so that it can be represented as an infinite structure.
For an infinite plasma-filled cylindrical waveguide located in free space, the full-wave approach presented in \cite{EskinPIERS2017_meth} was applied for the analysis of the energy characteristics of a helicon-type source \cite{OstafEskin_APRASC2019}.
However, in that type of radiating systems, it is often important to take into account the longitudinal boundedness of a plasma and consider the diffraction effects on the edges of a discharge \cite{Amatucci2011}.
%This can be realized by regarding the full spectrum of excited waves.
%The analysis of radiation characteristics of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of an open plasma-filled cylindrical waveguide of infinite length was performed in [] by taking into account the full spectrum of excited waves.
%Для правильного описания излучения необходимо учитывать конечность плазменного столба.

In this work, the main features of wave excitation by an antenna with the nonsymmetric electric-current distribution in the presence of a semi-infinite cylinder filled with a magnetoplasma are considered.
For finding the energy characteristics of such a source, an expansion of the excited field and fields of waves scattered by the endface of the cylinder over the set of eigenwaves of an infinite open gyrotropic waveguide \cite{EskinPIERS2017_meth} and free space is used.

\section{Formulation of the Problem}

Consider a semi-infinite cylinder of radius $ a $ that is located in free space and has the axis of symmetry coinciding with the $ z $ axis of the cylindrical coordinate system ($ \rho, \phi, z $).
The structure is placed in the region $ z<0 $, and its endface lies in the plane $ z=0 $ as is shown in Fig.~\ref{geometry}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]%[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=70mm]{figures/fig1.eps}
	\caption{Geometry of the problem.}
	\label{geometry}
\end{figure}
The field is excited by a given electric current specified on the side surface of the cylinder between planes $ z=-L-d $ and $ z=-L+d $ (see Fig.~\ref{geometry}) with the density written, with the $ \exp(i\omega t) $ time dependence dropped, as
\begin{align} \label{source_eq}
{\bf J}({\bf r})=&\,({\pmb\phi}_{0}j_{\phi}+{\bf z}_0j_z)\delta(\rho-a) \nonumber \\
&\times\exp\left(-im\phi-ik_0{\tilde p}z\right).
\end{align} 
Here, $ d $ is the half-length of the antenna (the condition $ d<L $ is fulfilled), integer $ m $ and the constant $ \tilde p $ determine the current dependence on the azimuthal and longitudinal coordinates, respectively, and $ k_0=\omega/c $ is the wave number in free space ($ c $  is the speed of light in free space).
The total amplitude of the current can be found as  $ |I_0|^2=|I_\phi|^2+|I_z|^2 $, where $ I_\phi=2dj_{\phi} $ and $ I_z=2\pi aj_z $.
The cylinder is aligned with an external static magnetic field $ \textbf{B}_{0}={B}_{0}\textbf{z}_{0} $ and filled with a cold collisionless magnetoplasma, which is described by the dielectric permittivity tensor
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\hat{\varepsilon}=\!\!
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\varepsilon & -ig & 0 \\
ig & \varepsilon & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \eta
\end{array}
\right),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align} \label{eq2}
&\varepsilon =\!1+\frac{\op^2}{\oH^2-\omega^2}+\frac{\Op^2}{\OH^2-\omega^2}, \quad
\eta=1-\frac{\op^2}{\omega^2}-\frac{\Op^2}{\omega^2},
 \nonumber \\
&\hspace{10mm}g=-\frac{\op^2\oH}{(\oH^2-\omega^2)\omega}+\frac{\Op^2\OH}{(\OH^2-\omega^2)\omega}.
\end{align}
Here, $ \op $ and $ \Op $ are the electron and ion plasma frequencies, and $ \oH $ and $ \OH $ are the gyrofrequencies of the corresponding particles, respectively.
It should be noted that the Gaussian system of units is used throughout the work.

%Let us consider a semi-infinite cylinder of radius $ a $ located in free space and filled with a cold collisionless magnetoplasma.
%The cylinder axis is parallel to an external static magnetic field $ \textbf{B}_{0} $ and coincides with the $ z $ axis of the cylindrical coordinate system ($ \rho, \phi, z $).
%The cylinder is located in the region $ z<0 $ and its endface lies in the plane $ z=0 $ as is shown in Fig.~\ref{geometry}.
%\begin{figure}[htbp]

%The plasma inside the cylinder is described by the dielectric permittivity tensor which has the following form for a monochromatic signal:
%\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
%\hat{\varepsilon}=\!\!
%\left(
%\begin{array}{ccc}

%\varepsilon &=\!1+\frac{\op^2}{\oH^2-\omega^2}+\frac{\Op^2}{\OH^2-\omega^2}, \nonumber \\
%g&=-\frac{\op^2\oH}{(\oH^2-\omega^2)\omega}+\frac{\Op^2\OH}{(\OH^2-\omega^2)\omega}, \\
%\eta&=1-\frac{\op^2}{\omega^2}-\frac{\Op^2}{\omega^2}. \nonumber
%\end{align}
%In (\ref{eq2}), the standard notations  $ \op $ and $ \Op $ for the electron and ion plasma frequencies, and $ \oH $ and $ \OH $ for the gyrofrequencies of the corresponding particles are used , respectively.
%The source is represented as an electric current specified on the side surface of the cylinder between planes $ z=-L-d $ and $ z=-L+d $ (see Fig.~\ref{geometry}).  The current density is written, with the $ \exp(i\omega t) $ time dependence dropped, as
%\begin{align} \label{source_eq}
%{\bf J}({\bf r})=&\,({\pmb\phi}_{0}j_{\phi}+{\bf z}_0j_z)\delta(\rho-a) \nonumber \\
%&\times\exp\left(-im\phi-ik_0{\tilde p}z\right).
%\end{align} 
%Here, $ d $ is the half-length of the antenna, $ L $ is the distance between the center of the antenna and the endface of the cylinder (the condition $ L>d $ is fulfilled). Integer $ m $ and the constant $ \tilde p $ determine the current dependence on the azimuthal and longitudinal coordinates, respectively, and $ k_0=\omega/c $ is the wave number in free space ($ c $  is the speed of light in free space).
%The total amplitude of the current can be found as  $ |I_0|^2=|I_\phi|^2+|I_z|^2 $, where $ I_\phi=2dj_{\phi} $ and $ I_z=2\pi aj_z $. 
%It should be noted that the Gaussian system of units is used throughout the work.

\section{The Source-Excited and Diffracted Fields}

On the basis of the cylindrical symmetry of the problem, the longitudinal components of the excited and diffracted wave fields can be represented as follows:  
\begin{equation}\label{modal_fields}
\begin{bmatrix} {E}_{z;s,m}({\bf r},q)\\ {	H}_{z;s,m}({\bf r},q)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} {E}_{z;s,m}(\rho, q)\\ {H}_{z;s,m}(\rho, q)\end{bmatrix}e^{-i m\f - i k_0
	p_{s}(q)z}.
\end{equation}
Here, the azimuthal index $ m $ is the same as in (\ref{source_eq}), the subscript $ s $  denotes the wave propagation direction, either positive ($ s=+ $) or negative ($ s=- $), $ q $ and $p_{s}(q)$ are the normalized (to $ k_{0} $) transverse and longitudinal wave numbers in free space, respectively.
%, and time dependence $ \exp(i\omega t) $ is omitted.
The function $ p_{s}(q) $ obeys the relation $p_{\rm +}(q)\equiv p(q)= -p_{\rm -}(q)$, where $ p(q)=(1-q^2)^{1/2} $.
It is assumed that $ {\rm Re}[p(q)]>0 $ if $ q $ is real and less than unity, and  $ {\rm Im}[p(q)]<0 $ otherwise.
The transverse field components  $E_{\rho;s,m}$, $E_{\f;s,m}$, $H_{\rho;s,m}$, and $H_{\f;s,m}$ can be found from the longitudinal components presented in (\ref{modal_fields}).
In what follows, we will assume that only the waves with the azimuthal index $ m $ are excited by the source.

As the given sources are regarded, it is supposed that the antenna current is not affected by the radiated and diffracted wave fields.
In the half-space $ z<0 $, the field excited by the current (\ref{source_eq}), is represented as an expansion in terms of eigenwaves of an open waveguide and is written in the source-free regions as
\begin{align}\label{eq4} 
&\hspace{-4mm}\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E_z^{(\rm exc)}}({\bf r})\\
{H_z^{(\rm exc)}}({\bf r})
\end{array}\!\!\!\right] = 
\sum_{n}a_{s,m,n}
\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E}_{z;s,m,n}(\rho)\\
{H}_{z;s,m,n}(\rho)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]e^{-im\f - ik_0 p_{s,m,n}z} \nonumber\\ 
&\hspace{0mm}+\sum_{\alpha=1}^2\,\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!a_{s,m,\alpha}(q)
\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E}_{z;s,m,\alpha}(\rho,q)\\
{H}_{z;s,m,\alpha}(\rho,q)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]e^{-im\f - ik_0 p_{s} z}dq.
\end{align}
Here, $ s=+ $ for $ z>-L+d $ and $ s=- $ for $ z<-L-d $; the functions $ E_{z;s,m,n}(\rho) $ and $ H_{z;s,m,n}(\rho) $ describe the radial distributions of the fields of the discrete-spectrum waves (eigenmodes) with the radial index $ n $ and the longitudinal wave numbers $ p_{s,m,n} $ ($ p_{+,m,n}=-p_{-,m,n}=p_{m,n} $);
the subscript $ \alpha $ corresponds to two kinds of the continuous-spectrum waves described by the functions $ E_{z;s,m,\alpha}(\rho,q) $ and $ H_{z;s,m,\alpha}(\rho,q) $.
Detailed expressions for these fields, which constitute the complete set of eigenwaves of an open gyrotropic cylindrical waveguide, can be found in \cite{EskinPIERS2017_meth}.
The quantities $ a_{s,m,n} $ and $ a_{s,m,\alpha}(q) $ are obtained using the well-known technique developed for finding the excitation coefficients of the modes of open waveguides \cite{Kondrat'ev1999} and are given by the expressions
\begin{align}\label{eq5}
a_{s,m,n}=&\frac{1}{N_{s,m,n}} \int{\bf J}({\bf r})\cdot{\bf E}^{({\rm T})}_{-s,-m,n}({\bf r})d{\bf r} \nonumber\\
=&\left[j_{\phi}{E}^{({\rm T})}_{\phi;-s,-m,n}(a) + j_z {E}^{({\rm T})}_{z;-s,-m,n}(a)\right] \nonumber \\
\times&\frac{4\pi a}{N_{s,m,n}}\frac{\sin\left[k_0(\tilde{p} - p_{s,m,n})d\right]}{k_0(\tilde{p} - p_{s,m,n})}e^{-ik_0p_{s,m,n}L}, \nonumber\\
a_{s,m,\alpha}(q)=&\frac{1}{N_{s,m,\alpha}(q)} \int{\bf J}({\bf r})\cdot{\bf E}^{({\rm T})}_{-s,-m,\alpha}({\bf r},q)d{\bf r} \nonumber \\
=&\left[j_{\phi}{E}^{({\rm T})}_{\phi;-s,-m,\alpha}(a,q) + j_z {E}^{({\rm T})}_{z;-s,-m,\alpha}(a,q)\right] \nonumber \\
\times&\frac{4\pi a}{N_{s,m,\alpha}(q)} \frac{\sin\left[k_0(\tilde{p} - p_s(q))d\right]}{k_0(\tilde{p} - p_s(q))}e^{-ik_0p_{s}L}, 
\end{align}
where integration is performed over the region occupied by the current (\ref{source_eq}), the superscript (T) denotes fields taken in an auxiliary medium that is described by the transposed dielectric permittivity tensor ${\hat{\varepsilon}}^{\rm T}$, and $ N_{s,m,n} $ and $ N_{s,m,\alpha}(q) $ are the norms of the discrete- and continuous-spectrum waves, respectively, which are given by the orthogonality relations presented in \cite{EskinPIERS2017_meth}.

The fields reflected from the cylinder endface to the region $ z<0 $ are also expanded in terms of eigenwaves of an infinite open gyrotropic waveguide.
The longitudinal components of the reflected field, hereafter marked by the superscript ($ \rm r $), are represented as
\begin{align}\label{eq6}
&\hspace{-4mm}\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E_z^{(\rm r)}}({\bf r})\\
{H_z^{(\rm r)}}({\bf r})
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!\!{=}\!\sum\limits_{n} b_{-,m,n}\!\!\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E}_{z;-,m,n}(\rho)\\
{H}_{z;-,m,n}(\rho)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!\!e^{-im\f + ik_0 p_{m,n}z}\notag\\
&+ \sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!b_{-,m,\alpha}(q)\!\!\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E}_{z;-,m,\alpha}(\rho,q)\\
{H}_{z;-,m,\alpha}(\rho,q)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!\!e^{-im\f + ik_0 p z}\,dq,
\end{align}
where $ b_{-,m,n} $ and $ b_{-,m,\alpha}(q) $ are the expansion coefficients to be found.
The longitudinal components of the field in the region $ z>0 $ are expanded in terms of the continuous-spectrum waves of free space as
\begin{align}\label{eq7}
&\hspace{-3mm}\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E_z^{(\rm sc)}}\\
{H_z^{(\rm sc)}}
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!
{=}\!\sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!\!\!\!\! c_{+,m,\gamma}(q)\!\!\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
E_{z;-,m,\gamma}(\rho,q)\\
H_{z;-,m,\gamma}(\rho,q)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!\!e^{-i m\f-ik_0 p z}{d}q,
\end{align}
where the superscript~$({\rm sc})$ denotes the fields scattered to free space, $\gamma=1$ and $\gamma=2$ correspond to the $E$- and $H$-polarized waves, respectively, and $ c_{+,m,\gamma}(q) $ are unknown coefficients depending on $ q $.
The eigenwaves of free space are written as
\begin{align}\label{eq8}
E_{z;s,m,\gamma}(\rho,q) {=} q J_m(k_0q \rho)\delta_{\gamma,1},\nonumber\\ H_{z;s,m,\gamma}(\rho,q) {=} q J_m(k_0q \rho)\delta_{\gamma,2},
\end{align}
where $J_m$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order $m$ and $\delta_{\rm
\alpha,\beta}$ is the Kronecker delta.

Satisfying the boundary conditions for the tangential field components at plane $ z=0 $
\begin{eqnarray}\label{bound_cond}
&&\hspace{-5mm}{E}^{(\rm exc)}_{\f}+{E}^{(\rm r)}_{\f}={E}^{(\rm sc)}_{\f},\quad {H}^{(\rm exc)}_{\f}+{H}^{(\rm r)}_{\f}={H}^{(\rm sc)}_{\f},\nonumber\\
&&\hspace{-5mm}{E}^{(\rm exc)}_{\rho}+{E}^{(\rm r)}_{\rho}={E}^{(\rm sc)}_{\rho},\quad {H}^{(\rm exc)}_{\rho}+{H}^{(\rm r)}_{\rho}={H}^{(\rm sc)}_{\rho},
\end{eqnarray}
and taking into account the orthogonality relations for the eigenwaves in both the regions $ z<0 $ and $ z>0 $, the system of integral equations for the expansion coefficients $ b_{-,m,n} $, $ b_{-,m,\alpha}(q) $, and $ c_{+,m,\gamma}(q) $ is derived in the following form:
\begin{align}
&c_{+,m,\gamma}(q)\tilde{N}_{+,m,\gamma}(q)=\sum_{n}a_{+,m,n}K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{+,m,n}(q) \nonumber\\
&+ \sum_{\alpha=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!a_{+,m,\alpha}(\tilde{q})K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{+,m,\alpha}(\tilde{q},q)d\tilde{q} \nonumber+\sum_{n}b_{-,m,n}K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{-,m,n}(q) \\
&+\sum_{\alpha=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!b_{-,m,\alpha}(\tilde{q})K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{-,m,\alpha}(\tilde{q},q)d\tilde{q}, \label{int_eq1} \\ 
&b_{-,m,n}N_{-,m,n}=\sum_{\gamma=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!\!c_{+,m,\gamma}(\tilde{q})M_{+,m,\gamma}^{+,-m,n}(\tilde{q})d\tilde{q}, \label{int_eq2} \\
&b_{-,m,\alpha}({q})N_{-,m,\alpha}({q})\!=\!\!\!\sum_{\gamma=1}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!c_{+,m,\gamma}(\tilde{q})M_{+,m,\gamma}^{+,-m,\alpha}(q,\tilde{q})d\tilde{q}. \label{int_eq3}
\end{align}
The norm of the eigenwaves of free space in \eqref{int_eq1} is given by the formula
\begin{equation}\label{norm_free_space}
\hspace{-7mm} {\tilde N}_{s,m,{\gamma}}({q})=(-1)^{m+\gamma}{c}{p_s}/({k_0^2}{q}),
\end{equation}
and the kernels of integral equations (\ref{int_eq1})--(\ref{int_eq3}) are written as
\begin{align}
&K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{s,m,n}(q)\!=\!\frac{c}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\!\!\!\!{d}{\phi}\!\!\!\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\left[{\bf E}_{s,m,{n}}({\bf r}){\times}{\bf H}_{-,-m,\gamma}({\bf r},{q})\right.\nonumber\\
&\hspace{15mm}\left. - {\bf E}_{-,-{m},\gamma}({\bf r},{q}){\times}{\bf H}_{s,m,{n}}({\bf r})\right]\!\!{\cdot}{\bf z}_0\rho{d}\rho,\nonumber\\
&K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{s,m,\a}(\tilde{q},q)\!=\!\frac{c}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\!\!\!\!{d}{\phi}\!\!\!\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\left[{\bf E}_{s,m,{\a}}({\bf r},\tilde{q}){\times}{\bf H}_{-,-m,\gamma}({\bf r},{q})\right.\nonumber\\
&\hspace{15mm}\left. - {\bf E}_{-,-{m},\gamma}({\bf r},{q}){\times}{\bf H}_{s,m,{\a}}({\bf r},\tilde{q})\right]\!\!{\cdot}{\bf z}_0\rho{d}\rho,\nonumber\\
&M_{+,m,\gamma}^{+,-m,n}(\tilde{q})\!=\!\frac{c}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\!\!\!\!{d}{\phi}\!\!\!\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\left[{\bf E}_{+,m,{\gamma}}({\bf r},\tilde{q}){\times}{\bf H}^{({\rm T})}_{+,-m,n}({\bf r})\right.\nonumber\\
&\hspace{15mm}\left. - {\bf E}^{({\rm T})}_{+,-{m},n}({\bf r}){\times}{\bf H}_{+,m,{\gamma}}({\bf r},\tilde{q})\right]\!\!{\cdot}{\bf z}_0\rho{d}\rho,\nonumber\\
&M_{+,m,\gamma}^{+,-m,\alpha}(q,\tilde{q})\!=\!\frac{c}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\!\!\!\!{d}{\phi}\!\!\!\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\left[{\bf E}_{+,m,{\gamma}}({\bf r},\tilde{q}){\times}{\bf H}^{({\rm T})}_{+,-m,\alpha}({\bf r},q)\right.\nonumber\\

\end{align}
The power carried by the wave with the azimuthal index $ m $ to the negative direction of the $ z $-axis is determined via the expansion coefficients of the source-excited and backscattered fields as
\begin{align}
P_{\rm mod}=&\sum_{n}P_{n}=\sum_{n}|a_{-,m,n}+b_{-,m,n}|^2{\cal P}_{+,m,n} \label{P_mod}
\end{align}
for the discrete-spectrum waves
($ P_{n} $ is the partial power going to the $ n $-th eigenmode) and
\begin{align}
P_{\rm cs}=&\sum_{\alpha=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{1}|a_{-,m,\a}(q)+b_{-,m,\a}(q)|^2{\cal P}_{+,m,\a}(q)dq \label{P_cs}
\end{align}
for the continuous-spectrum waves, where $ {\cal P}_{s,m,n} $ and $ {\cal P}_{s,m,\alpha} $ are defined by the power orthogonality relations presented in \cite{OstafEskin_APRASC2019}.
In obtaining \eqref{P_mod} and \eqref{P_cs}, the relations $ {\cal P}_{+,m,n}=-{\cal P}_{-,m,n} $ and $ {\cal P}_{+,m,\alpha}(q)=-{\cal P}_{-,m,\alpha}(q) $ have been used.
%\begin{equation}
%{\cal P}_{s, m, \begin{bmatrix} n \\ \alpha\end{bmatrix}}
%\end{equation}
The power scattered from the cylinder endface to the region $ z>0 $ is written via the expansion coefficients for waves in free space:
\begin{equation}\label{forward_powers}
P_{\rm fs}=\sum_{\gamma=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{1}|c_{+,m,\gamma}(q)|^2\frac{cp(q)}{4k_{0}^{2}q}dq.
\end{equation}
%$ {\tilde {\cal P}}_{+,m,\gamma}=c{\rm Re}\left[p(q)/4k_{0}^{2}q\right] $.
%\begin{equation}\label{forward_powers}
%P_{\rm fs}=\sum_{\gamma=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{1}|c_{+,m,\gamma}(q)|^2{\tilde {\cal P}}_{+,m,\gamma}(q)dq,
%\end{equation}
%where $ {\tilde {\cal P}}_{+,m,\gamma}=1/4(-1)^{\gamma+1}\tilde{N}_{+,m,\gamma} $.

\section{Numerical results}
The integral equations \eqref{int_eq1}--\eqref{int_eq3} have numerically been solved using the Simpson's integration method.
The powers going to the eigenwaves of the cylinder and free space have been calculated for the values of parameters in \eqref{source_eq} $ a=2{.}5 $\,cm, $ d=4a $, $ {\tilde p}=0 $, and $ m=1 $, which are typical of helical antennas used in gaseous plasma tubes for producing helicon waves.
It is assumed that the frequency of the source belongs to the resonant interval $ \omega_{\rm LH}<\omega<\oH $ of the whistler range, where $ \omega_{\rm LH}=(\oH\OH)^{1/2} $ is the lower-hybrid frequency.
The values of dimensionless parameters $\o_{p}/\o_{H} = 12{.}7$, $  \omega_{\rm LH}/\oH=3{.}7\times10^{-3} $ and  $\o_{H} a/c = 1{.}17$ of a plasma medium have been used for calculations.
Note that, due to a resonance character of a plasma in the considered frequency range, the cylinder supports an infinite number of the propagating eigenmodes.
Figure~\ref{fig_P_from_L} shows the powers $ P_{\rm mod} $ and $ P_{\rm cs} $ as functions of $ L $ that varies in the range $ 5a<L<2\lambda_{0} $ ($ \lambda_{0}=2\pi/k_{0}\gg a$ is the free-space wavelength). All the values presented in this and forthcoming figures are normalized to the total power $ P_{0} $ radiated from the same source located in free space.

The oscillations in the dependence $ P_{\rm mod}(L) $ are related to the interference of the small-scaled eigenmodes with the different propagation constants.
The power $ P_{\rm cs} $ carried by the continuous-spectrum waves increases significantly at certain values of $ L/\lambda_{0} $, remaining to be less than $ P_{\rm mod} $.
As was shown by the calculations, the relation $ P_{\rm fs} \simeq P_{\rm mod} $ is justified for the power scattered to free space for each value of $ L $.
Thus, most of the radiated power goes to the negative $ z $-axis direction by means of the eigenmode waves.

The distributions of the partial powers $P_n$ over the discrete-spectrum waves (for only the first $ 75 $ eigenmodes for which $ p_{n}<200 $) are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig_P_mod}(a) and \ref{fig_P_mod}(b) for two values of $ L/\lambda_{0} $.

%In both the cases, the most efficient excitation is observed for the modes with $ p_{n}<? $.
In the case presented in Fig.~\ref{fig_P_mod}(a), the ratio of the power going to the discrete-spectrum waves to the power going to the continuous spectrum waves amounts its minimum $ P_{\rm mod}/(P_{\rm cs}+P_{\rm fs})=3{.}028 $ at $ L=0{.}423\lambda_{0} $.
The corresponding value of $ L/\lambda_{0} $ is indicated by the vertical dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig_P_from_L}.
The ratio of the powers changes periodically with increasing $ L $ and reaches one of its maximum values $ P_{\rm mod}/(P_{\rm cs}+P_{\rm fs})=2\cdot10^{3} $ at $ L=0{.}696\lambda_{0} $.
For this case, the distribution of $P_n$ over the set of the eigenwaves is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig_P_mod}(b).
It follows from the comparison of the panels (a) and (b) in Fig.~\ref{fig_P_mod} that the notable redistribution of the partial powers over the eigenmode spectrum occurs when the parameter $ L/\lambda_{0} $ changes.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work, the electromagnetic wave excitation has been studied in the case where the nonsymmetric given source is placed on the surface of a semi-infinite cylinder filled with a magnetoplasma.
The integral equations for the field expansion coefficients of waves diffracted from the endface of the cylinder have been derived and numerically solved.
The partial powers going to the discrete- and continuous-spectrum waves as functions of the distance from the antenna to the cylinder endface have been analysed. 
It has been demonstrated that in the considered frequency range almost all the radiated power goes to the eigenmodes, reflecting from the endface.
It has also been established that the part of the power that goes to the continuous-specrtum waves noticeably depends on the source position.
%The obtained results can be expanded to the case of any hyperbolic medium.
