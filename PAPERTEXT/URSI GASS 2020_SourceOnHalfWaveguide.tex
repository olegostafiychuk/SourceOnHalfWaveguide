\begin{abstract}
 Electromagnetic wave excitation by sources with nonsymmetric electric-current distribution in the presence of a semi-infinite gyrotropic cylinder is considered.
 It is assumed that the sources are specified on the surface of the cylinder located in free space.
 The total source-excited field and the fields scattered by the end-face of the cylinder are expanded in terms of eigenwaves of an infinite open waveguide and free space.
 The powers radiated from the source in both the directions of the cylinder are numerically calculated and the radiation pattern for the far-zone field is determined.
 Conditions are found..

\section{Introduction}

In the past decades, an enhanced attention has been paid to the problem of electromagnetic wave excitation in systems including open gyrotropic guiding structures and given electric currents.
In the case of employing a magnetized plasma as a gyrotropic medium, such a model can be used for describing antennas operated in laboratory devices -- helicon plasma sources, which are used in numerous experimental researches \cite{Chen_review_2015}.
In that type of radiating systems, it is important to take into account the finite size of a plasma column  when diffraction effects on its end-face take place.
However, most theoretical studies devoted to such sources deal with the case where antenna is placed far from the ends of a plasma column so that it can be represented as an infinite cylinder [].
Moreover, in most works consideration is limited to the excitation of only the discrete-spectrum waves (eigenmodes).
%which play a major role in forming the plasma discharge.
%The analysis of radiation characteristics of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of an open plasma-filled cylindrical waveguide of infinite length was performed in [] by taking into account the full spectrum of excited waves.
In the case of a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of an infinite plasma-filled cylindrical waveguide surrounded by free space, the full spectrum of excited waves has been taken into account for determining the energy characteristics \cite{OstafEskin_APRASC2019} and radiation patterns \cite{OstafEskin_ICEAA2019} of such a source.
%Для правильного описания излучения необходимо учитывать конечность плазменного столба.

In this work the features of wave excitation by a nonsymmetric antenna located on the surface of a semi-infinite gyrotropic cylinder are considered.
The investigation of the excited field and fields of waves scattered by the end-face of the cylinder is performed using an expansion of these fields over the set of eigenwaves of an infinite open gyrotropic waveguide \cite{EskinPIERS2017_meth} and free space.

\section{Formulation of the Problem}

Let us consider a semi-infinite cylinder of radius $ a $ located in free space and filled with a cold collisionless magnetoplasma.
The cylinder axis is parallel to an external static magnetic field $ \textbf{B}_{0} $ and coincides with the $ z $ axis of the cylindrical coordinate system ($ \rho, \phi, z $).
The cylinder is located in the region $ z<0 $ and its endface lies in the plane $ z=0 $.
The plasma inside the cylinder is described by dielectric permittivity tensor which has the following form for a monochromatic signal:
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\hat{\varepsilon}=\epsilon_{0}\!\!
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\varepsilon & -ig & 0 \\
ig & \varepsilon & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \eta
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}
Here, $ \epsilon_{0} $ is the permittivity of free space, and the quantities $\varepsilon$, $g$, and $\eta$ for a cold collisionless magnetoplasma can be written as
\begin{align} \label{eq2}
\varepsilon &=\!1+\frac{\op^2}{\oH^2-\omega^2}+\frac{\Op^2}{\OH^2-\omega^2}, \nonumber \\
g&=-\frac{\op^2\oH}{(\oH^2-\omega^2)\omega}+\frac{\Op^2\OH}{(\OH^2-\omega^2)\omega}, \\
\eta&=1-\frac{\op^2}{\omega^2}-\frac{\Op^2}{\omega^2}. \nonumber
\end{align}
In (\ref{eq2}), the standard notations  $ \op $ and $ \Op $ for the electron and ion plasma frequencies, and $ \oH $ and $ \OH $ for the gyrofrequencies of the corresponding particles are used , respectively.
The source is represented as an electric current specified on the side surface of the cylinder with density written, with the $ \exp(i\omega t) $ time dependence dropped, as
\begin{align} \label{eq3}
{\bf J}({\bf r})=&\,({\pmb\phi}_{0}j_{\phi}+{\bf z}_0j_z)\delta(\rho-a) \nonumber \\
&\times\exp\left(-im\phi-ik_0{\tilde p}z\right),\\
&-L-d<z<-L+d. \nonumber
\end{align} 
Here, $ d $ is the half-length of the antenna, $ L $ is the distance between the center of the antenna and the endface of the cylinder (the condition $ L>d $ is fulfilled). Integer $ m $ and the constant $ \tilde p $ determine the current dependence on the azimuthal and longitudinal coordinates, respectively, and $ k_0=\omega/c $ is the wave number in free space ($ c $  is the speed of light in free space).
The total amplitude of the current can be found as  $ |I_0|^2=|I_\phi|^2+|I_z|^2 $, where $ I_\phi=2dj_{\phi} $ and $ I_z=2\pi aj_z $. 

%The paper should include an abstract and the usual subsections and should

%\emph{Radio Science Bulletin}).  Citations can be of the
%form~\cite{cannon,mannix} as is appropriate to the sentence, with the

\section{The Source-Excited and Diffracted Fields}

On the basis of the cylindrical symmetry of the problem, the excited and diffracted fields can be represented via their longitudinal components as follows:  
\begin{equation}\label{modal_fields}
\begin{bmatrix} {E}_{z;s,m}({\bf r},q)\\ {	H}_{z;s,m}({\bf r},q)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} {E}_{z;s,m}(\rho, q)\\ {H}_{z;s,m}(\rho, q)\end{bmatrix}e^{-i m\f - i k_0
	p_{s}(q)z}.
\end{equation}
Here, the azimuthal index $ m $ is the same as in (\ref{eq3}), the subscript $ s $  denotes the wave propagation direction, either positive ($ s=+ $) or negative ($ s=- $), $ q $ and $p_{s}(q)$ are the normalized (to $ k_{0} $) transverse and longitudinal wave numbers in free space, respectively, and time dependence $ \exp(i\omega t) $ is omitted.
The function $ p_{s}(q) $ obeys the relation $p_{\rm +}(q)\equiv p(q)= -p_{\rm -}(q)$, where $ p(q)=(1-q^2)^{1/2} $.
It is assumed that $ {\rm Re}[p(q)]>0 $ if $ q $ is real and less than unity, and  $ {\rm Im}[p(q)]<0 $ otherwise.
The transverse field components  $E_{\rho;s,m}$, $E_{\f;s,m}$, $H_{\rho;s,m}$, and $H_{\f;s,m}$ can be found from the longitudinal components presented in (\ref{modal_fields}). \cite{Kondratev1999}.

In half-space $ z<0 $, the field excited by the current (\ref{eq3}) is represented as an expansion in terms of eigenwaves of an open waveguide and is written in the source-free regions as
\begin{align}\label{eq4} 
&\hspace{-4mm}\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E_z^{(\rm rad)}}({\bf r})\\
{H_z^{(\rm rad)}}({\bf r})
\end{array}\!\!\!\right] = 
\sum_{n}a_{s,m,n}
\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E}_{z;s,m,n}(\rho)\\
{H}_{z;s,m,n}(\rho)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]e^{-i(m\f + k_0 p_{s,m,n}z)} \nonumber\\ 
&\hspace{0mm}+\sum_{\alpha=1}^2\,\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!a_{s,m,\alpha}(q)
\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E}_{z;s,m,\alpha}(\rho,q)\\
{H}_{z;s,m,\alpha}(\rho,q)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]e^{-i(m\f + k_0 p_{s} z)}dq.
\end{align}
The functions $ E_{z;s,m,n}(\rho) $ and $ H_{z;s,m,n}(\rho) $ describe the radial distributions of the fields of the eigenmodes (discrete-spectrum waves) with the radial index $ n $ and the longitudinal wave numbers $ p_{s,m,n} $ ($ p_{+,m,n}=-p_{-,m,n} $);
the subscript $ \alpha $ corresponds to two kinds of the continuous-spectrum waves described by the functions $ E_{z;s,m,\alpha}(\rho,q) $ and $ H_{z;s,m,\alpha}(\rho,q) $.
Detailed expressions for these fields, which constitute the complete set of eigenwaves of an open gyrotropic cylindrical waveguide, can be found in \cite{OstafEskin_ICEAA2019}.
The quantities $ a_{s,m,n} $ and $ a_{s,m,\alpha}(q) $ are obtained using the well-known technique developed for finding the excitation coefficients of the modes of open waveguides \cite{Kondrat'ev1999} and are given by the formulas
\begin{align}\label{eq5}
a_{s,m,n}=&\frac{1}{N_{s,m,n}} \int{\bf J}({\bf r})\cdot{\bf E}^{({\rm T})}_{-s,-m,n}({\bf r})d{\bf r} \nonumber\\
=&\left[j_{\phi}{E}^{({\rm T})}_{\phi;-s,-m,n}(a) + j_z {E}^{({\rm T})}_{z;-s,-m,n}(a)\right] \nonumber \\
\times&\frac{4\pi a}{N_{s,m,n}}\frac{\sin\left[k_0(\tilde{p} - p_{s,m,n})d\right]}{k_0(\tilde{p} - p_{s,m,n})}e^{-ik_0p_{s,m,n}L}, \nonumber\\
a_{s,m,\alpha}(q)=&\frac{1}{N_{s,m,\alpha}(q)} \int{\bf J}({\bf r})\cdot{\bf E}^{({\rm T})}_{-s,-m,\alpha}({\bf r},q)d{\bf r} \nonumber \\
=&\left[j_{\phi}{E}^{({\rm T})}_{\phi;-s,-m,\alpha}(a,q) + j_z {E}^{({\rm T})}_{z;-s,-m,\alpha}(a,q)\right] \nonumber \\
\times&\frac{4\pi a}{N_{s,m,\alpha}(q)} \frac{\sin\left[k_0(\tilde{p} - p_s(q))d\right]}{k_0(\tilde{p} - p_s(q))}e^{-ik_0p_{s}L}, 
\end{align}
where integration is performed over the region occupied by the current (\ref{eq3}), the superscript (T) denotes fields taken in an auxiliary medium that is described by the transposed dielectric permittivity tensor ${\hat{\varepsilon}}^{\rm T}$, and $ N_{m,n} $ and $ N_{m,\alpha}(q) $ are the norms of the discrete- and continuous-spectrum waves, respectively, which are given by the orthogonality relations presented in \cite{EskinPIERS2017_meth}.

The field scattered from the endface to the region $ z<0 $ is also expanded in terms eigenwaves of an open gyrotropic cylinder.
The longitudinal components of the backscattered field, hereafter marked by the superscript ($ \rm r $), are represented as
\begin{align}\label{eq6}
&\hspace{-4mm}\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E_z^{(\rm r)}}({\bf r})\\
{H_z^{(\rm r)}}({\bf r})
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!\!{=}\!\sum\limits_{n} b_{m,n}\!\!\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E}_{z;-,m,n}(\rho)\\
{H}_{z;-,m,n}(\rho)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!\!e^{-i(m\f - k_0 p_{m,n}z)}\notag\\
&+ \sum\limits_{\beta=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!b_{m,\beta}(q)\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E}_{z;-,m,\beta}(\rho,q)\\
{H}_{z;-,m,\beta}(\rho,q)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!\!e^{-i(m\f - k_0 p z)}{d}q,
\end{align}
where $ b_{m,n} $ and $ b_{m,\beta}(q) $ are the unknown expansion coefficients to be found, and $ \beta $ is the same as $ \alpha $.
%Note that the fields of the discrete- and continuous-spectrum waves satisfy the orthogonality relations
The longitudinal components of the fields in half-space $ z>0 $ are expanded in terms of the continuous-spectrum waves of free space as
\begin{align}\label{eq7}
&\hspace{-3mm}\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
{E_z^{(\rm sc)}}\\
{H_z^{(\rm sc)}}
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!
{=}\!\sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!\!\!\!\! c_{m,\gamma}(q)\!\!\left[\!\!\!
\begin{array}{c}
E_{z;-,m,\gamma}(\rho,q)\\
H_{z;-,m,\gamma}(\rho,q)
\end{array}\!\!\!\right]\!\!e^{-i m\f+ik_0 p z}{d}q,
\end{align}
where the superscript~$({\rm sc})$ denotes the fields scattered in free space, $\gamma=1$ and $\gamma=2$ correspond to the $E$- and $H$-polarized waves, respectively, and $ c_{m,\gamma}(q) $ are unknown coefficients depending on $ q $.
The eigenwaves of free space are written as
\begin{align}\label{eq8}
E_{z;s,m,\gamma}(\rho,q) {=} q J_m(k_0q \rho)\delta_{\gamma,1},\nonumber\\ H_{z;s,m,\gamma}(\rho,q) {=} q J_m(k_0q \rho)\delta_{\gamma,2},
\end{align}
where, $J_m$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order $m$ and $\delta_{\rm
\alpha,\beta}$ is the Kronecker delta.

Using the boundary conditions
\begin{eqnarray}\label{bound_cond}
&&{E}^{(\rm rad)}_{\f}+{E}^{(\rm r)}_{\f}={E}^{(\rm sc)}_{\f},\quad {H}^{(\rm rad)}_{\f}+{H}^{(\rm r)}_{\f}={H}^{(\rm sc)}_{\f},\nonumber\\
&&{E}^{(\rm rad)}_{\rho}+{E}^{(\rm r)}_{\rho}={E}^{(\rm sc)}_{\rho},\quad {H}^{(\rm rad)}_{\rho}+{H}^{(\rm r)}_{\rho}={H}^{(\rm sc)}_{\rho}
\end{eqnarray}
for the tangential field components at plane $ z=0 $ and taking into account the orthogonality relations for eigenwaves of an open gyrotropic cylinder [], the system of integral equations for the expansion coefficients $ b_{m,n} $, $ b_{m,\beta}(q) $ and $ c_{m,\gamma}(q) $ is derived in the following form:
\begin{align}
c_{m,\gamma}(q)\tilde{N}_{+,m,\gamma}(q)&=\sum_{n}a_{+,m,n}K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{+,m,n}(q) \nonumber\\
&\hspace{-23mm}+ \sum_{\alpha=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!a_{+,m,\alpha}(\tilde{q})K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{+,m,\alpha}(\tilde{q},q)d\tilde{q} \nonumber+\sum_{n}b_{m,n}K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{-,m,n}(q) \\
&\hspace{-23mm}+\sum_{\beta=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!b_{+,m,\beta}(\tilde{q})K_{-,-m,\gamma}^{-,m,\beta}(\tilde{q},q)d\tilde{q}, \label{int_eq1} \\
b_{m,\beta}(q)N_{-,m,\beta}(q)&=\sum_{\gamma=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!\!\!c_{m,\gamma}(\tilde{q})K_{+,-m,\beta}^{+,m,\gamma}(\tilde{q},q)d\tilde{q}, \label{int_eq2} \\
b_{m,n}N_{-,m,n}&=\sum_{\gamma=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\!c_{m,\gamma}K_{+,-m,n}^{+,m,\gamma} \label{int_eq3}.
\end{align}
The norm of the continuous-spectrum waves of free space in \eqref{int_eq1} is given by the expression
\begin{equation}\label{norm_free_space}
\hspace{-7mm} {\tilde N}_{s,m,{\alpha}}({q})=(-1)^{m+\alpha}{c}{p_s}/({k_0^2}{q}),
\end{equation}
and the kernels of integral equations (\ref{int_eq1})--(\ref{int_eq3}) are written as
\begin{align}
K_{\tilde{s},-m,\gamma}^{s,m,n}(q)=&\frac{c}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left({\bf E}_{s,m,{n}}({\bf r})\times{\bf H}_{\tilde{s},-m,\gamma}({\bf r},{q})\right.\nonumber\\
&\left. - {\bf E}_{\tilde{s},-{m},\gamma}({\bf r},{q})\times{\bf H}_{s,m,{n}}({\bf r})\right)\cdot{\bf z}_0\rho{d}\rho,\nonumber\\
K_{\tilde{s},-m,\gamma}^{s,m,\a}(\tilde{q},q)=&\frac{c}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left({\bf E}_{s,m,{\a}}({\bf r},\tilde{q})\times{\bf H}_{\tilde{s},-m,\gamma}({\bf r},{q})\right.\nonumber\\
&\left. - {\bf E}_{\tilde{s},-{m},\gamma}({\bf r},{q})\times{\bf H}_{s,m,{\a}}({\bf r},\tilde{q})\right)\cdot{\bf z}_0\rho{d}\rho,\nonumber\\
K_{+,-m,n}^{+,m,\gamma}(q)=&\frac{c}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left({\bf E}_{+,m,{\gamma}}({\bf r},q)\times{\cir{\bf H}}_{+,-m,n}({\bf r})\right.\nonumber\\
&\left. - {\cir{\bf E}}_{+,-{m},n}({\bf r})\times{\bf H}_{s,m,{\gamma}}({\bf r},q)\right)\cdot{\bf z}_0\rho{d}\rho,\nonumber\\
K_{+,-m,\beta}^{+,m,\gamma}(\tilde{q},q)=&\frac{c}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left({\bf E}_{+,m,{\gamma}}({\bf r},\tilde{q})\times{\cir{\bf H}}_{+,-m,\beta}({\bf r},q)\right.\nonumber\\
&\left. - {\cir{\bf E}}_{+,-{m},\beta}({\bf r},\tilde{q})\times{\bf H}_{s,m,{\gamma}}({\bf r},q)\right)\cdot{\bf z}_0\rho{d}\rho, \label{eq14}
\end{align}
where the circle above the symbols denotes the fields in a medium described by the transposed dielectric tensor $ \hat{\varepsilon}^{\rm T} $.

%\section{Power radiated}
When the expansion coefficients are found, the powers going into eigenwaves can be determined as
\begin{align}
P_{\rm mod}^{-}=&\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n}|a_{-,m,n}+b_{m,n}|^2N_{-,m,n}, \label{back_powers1}\\
P_{cs}^{-}=&\frac{1}{4}\sum_{\alpha=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{1}|a_{-,m,\a}+b_{m,\a}(q)|^2N_{-,m,\a}(q)dq \label{back_powers2}
\end{align}
for the waves propagating along the cylinder in the negative $ z $-direction and
\begin{equation}\label{forward_powers}
P_{cs}^{+}=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{\gamma=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{1}|c_{m,\gamma}|^2\tilde{N}_{+,m,\gamma}(q)dq
\end{equation}
for the waves scattered from the cylinder endface to the region $ z>0 $.
The formulas \eqref{back_powers1}--\eqref{forward_powers} were obtained using the power orthogonality relations [], which are satisfied for a lossless medium.
